# Weebs UwUnited

As a team we wanted to build a webapp based on our common interests. We agreed upon anime but quickly realized that everyones knowledge on it varied.
That sparked an idea for us, why not create a webapp that could assist the user in finding the perfect gift for their friends that may not watch the same anime.

Together we learned how to:

- Use the power of friendship; to work seamlessly with a team on GitHub.
- Apply two server-side API's and store it's data client-side.
- Use stored data to create a favorites page.
- Create a modal and use our stored data within it.
- Use Tailwind as our CSS framework.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Limitations

Amazon API requires personal keys, each limits to 200 fetches. Solution is swap keys once limit is reached.
The favorites button during the search will not be functional until the products from Amazon are fetched.
